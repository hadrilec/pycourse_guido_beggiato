# *pycourse*

A python course that builds on the fundamentals, starting from scratch !

The endgoal is to get confident enough in order to be able to autonomously study further topics.

This course deals in particular with:
- programming fundamentals
- the python standard library

Given the intended audience, some specific techniques and practices relative to the data analysis world will be touched.

In order to enrich the explanation and to stimulate curiosity, some references to lower level concepts may arise -- these are not really needed in a pure-python world.
